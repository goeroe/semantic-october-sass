# Semantic-October (Sass)
### Based on semantic-ui-sass by [doabit](https://github.com/doabit/semantic-ui-sass)

The Sass version of Semantic-October is not quite there yet (not using global variables) but lets hope we will evolve to a version that does.

### Installation

1. Install theme
2. Open theme folder (/themes/semantic-october-sass)
3. bower update (npm install -g bower - if not installed)
4. npm install laravel-elixir (if not installed)
5. npm install gulp (if not installed)
6. gulp

DONE...
